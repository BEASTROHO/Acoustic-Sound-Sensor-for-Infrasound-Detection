# Acoustic-Sound-Sensor-for-Infrasound-Detection
"Developed during an internship at NIT Tiruchirappalli, this project uses an acoustic sensor with STM32 to detect infrasound signals (&lt;20 Hz). Features include real-time signal capture, threshold-based event detection, waveform analysis, and 3D-printed enclosures for deployment.
